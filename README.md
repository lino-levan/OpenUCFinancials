# OpenUCFinancials

This is a project to create a resource for students to understand the financials
of the University of California system. The goal is to provide a comprehensive
overview of the financials of the UC system, specifically focused on salaries.

Everything is built with love and [Deno](https://deno.com/).

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
